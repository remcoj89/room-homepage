## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

The lessons I have drawn from this assignment include a better understanding of the useContext hook. I have learned how to use it to control the state, allowing the state to be utilized in multiple components.

I have gained a better insight into styling components and the use of variables and mixins in SCSS. Additionally, I made an effort to adhere as much as possible to the 7-1 folder structure, making it simpler to manage CSS.


### Continued development


The areas were I want to imporve myself is to get a better understanding in the react libary. I want to know more about how to manage the state
with for example redux and get a deeper understanding of the different react Hooks.

I also want to improve my (s)css skill to create a more pixle perfect web applications and play arround width animations


### Useful resources

- [Sass guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es) - This helped me for the structure and usage of the scss framework the explanation is very clear and detailed.
- [Reac documentation](https://react.dev/) - The react documentation helped me mostly width the state manegement of the the app.
